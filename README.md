# TLayer-Wise Graph Neural Network

## Requirements

python == 3.7.6

torch == 1.8.1

dgl == 0.5.2

## Results

We run 'DGL_train_citation' to get the results of we reproduced model GCN, GAT, SAGE, SGC, GIN, and APPNP on citation datasets.
We run 'DGL_train_WebKB' to get the results of we reproduced model on heterophily datasets.

We run 'LGEN_train_citation' to get the results of GEN on citation datasets
We run 'GEN_train_WebKB' to get the results of GEN on heterophily datasets.

We run 'LGEN_analysis' to get the edge homophily ratio 'h'.
